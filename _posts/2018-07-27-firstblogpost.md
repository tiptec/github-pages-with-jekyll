In this episode of Codespanalytics, We will give your a brief summary of our aims and objectives as an organization and outline the benefits 
the public stand to gain with this initiative. As Nigeria's renown and most trusted Edtech Non profit organization, we run survey and share
our results to help the public identify the gaps and opportunities that exist in the Edtech industry while telling a story of our impact as
an organization. We want to empower the public and the government by providing them with rich information about trends and metrics measured
on digital literacy across the 36 states. And we want to use this information to educate investors, sponsors, public and private organizations
about ways they can help bridge the technology divide.

In a few weeks, we'll run our first survey and publish them after anonymising the identity of responders and visualizing it in the best possible
format.

Watch the space!!!
