My name is **Olabode Ogunfuye** and I am the Program Manager/Co-Founder at Codespark Foundation... We are an EdTech Non-Profit Organization and we turn programming into play for young kids in Nigeria by sparking their interest thus bridging the digital literacy gaps through our efforts.

Data is critical to understanding user generated patterns and as we impact lives and go about our yearly activities, we actively gather user generated data through survey/questionnaires and other anonymonized data generated by users of our digital solutions. This data are collected for the purpose of telling the impact story and providing insight to the public on the existing digital literacy gaps and opportunities in the education/technology industry. Data are also collected on learning patterns across age range and demography.

We try to answer questions like:
- Demography distribution of digital literacy impacts
- Identifying location with high and low digital exposure
- Best mode of learning for teens with zero knowledge of technology and programming
- Number of schools with resources that help breed technology innovation
- Actual Level of Digital Literacy in the Nigeria

- Gender equality in digital literacy efforts
- Internet availablity at teen homes, church and school
